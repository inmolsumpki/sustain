Before you proceed, make sure you have a blank DVD or a USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of space. You will also need an internet connection and a valid product key for Windows 7 Home Premium x64.
  
## Step 1: Go to the Dell Support Website
  
The first step is to go to the Dell support website and enter your service tag or express service code. This is a unique identifier for your laptop that can be found on a sticker on the bottom of your laptop or in the BIOS settings.
  
Once you enter your service tag or express service code, you will see a list of drivers and downloads for your laptop model. Click on the "Operating System" category and then on the "Windows 7 Home Premium x64" option.
  
## Step 2: Download the Recovery Image
  
The next step is to download the recovery image file that contains the Windows 7 Home Premium x64 operating system and the Dell drivers and applications. This file is usually around 4 GB in size and may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.
  
To download the recovery image file, click on the "Download" button next to it and save it to your computer. You may need to enter your product key to verify that you are eligible to download the file.
  
## Step 3: Create the Recovery Disks
  
The final step is to create the recovery disks using the recovery image file that you downloaded. You can either burn it to a DVD or copy it to a USB flash drive.
  
To burn it to a DVD, you will need a DVD burner software such as ImgBurn or CDBurnerXP. Simply launch the software, select the recovery image file as the source and the blank DVD as the destination, and start the burning process.
  
To copy it to a USB flash drive, you will need a USB creator tool such as Rufus or UNetbootin. Simply launch the tool, select the recovery image file as the ISO image and the USB flash drive as the device, and start the creation process.
  
## Step 4: Use the Recovery Disks
  
Once you have created the recovery disks, you can use them to restore your Dell N5110 laptop to its original factory settings. To do that, you will need to boot from the DVD or USB flash drive that contains the recovery image.
  
To boot from the DVD or USB flash drive, you may need to change the boot order in the BIOS settings or use a boot menu key such as F12. Once you boot from the recovery disk, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the recovery process.
