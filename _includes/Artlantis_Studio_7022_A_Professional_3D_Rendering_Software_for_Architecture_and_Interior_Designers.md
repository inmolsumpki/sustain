In this article, we will show you how to use Artlantis Studio 7.0.2.2 to create a 3D render of a living room. You will learn how to import a 3D model, apply materials and textures, add lights and shadows, adjust the camera and the perspective, and render the final image.
 
## Step 1: Import a 3D model
 
The first step is to import a 3D model of the living room that you want to render. You can use any 3D modeling software that you are familiar with, such as SketchUp, Revit, ArchiCAD, Rhino, etc. You can also download ready-made models from online sources, such as 3D Warehouse, TurboSquid, CGTrader, etc. Make sure that your model is in one of the supported formats by Artlantis Studio 7.0.2.2, such as DXF, DWG, OBJ, FBX, 3DS, or IFC.
 
To import your model, open Artlantis Studio 7.0.2.2 and click on the File menu and select Open. Browse to the location of your model file and click Open. You will see your model in the main window of Artlantis Studio 7.0.2.2.
 
## Step 2: Apply materials and textures
 
The next step is to apply materials and textures to your model to give it more realism and detail. Materials are the properties of the surfaces of your model, such as color, reflection, transparency, bump, etc. Textures are images that are mapped onto the surfaces of your model to create patterns, details, or effects.
 
To apply materials and textures to your model, you can use the built-in library of Artlantis Studio 7.0.2.2 or import your own images. The library contains hundreds of predefined materials and textures for various categories, such as wood, metal, stone, fabric, glass, etc. You can access the library by clicking on the Catalog button on the toolbar or by pressing F4 on your keyboard.
 
To apply a material or a texture from the library to your model, simply drag and drop it onto the surface that you want to modify. You will see a preview of the material or texture on your model in the main window. You can also adjust the parameters of the material or texture by clicking on the Inspector button on the toolbar or by pressing F5 on your keyboard.
 
To import your own images as materials or textures, you can click on the Import button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+I on your keyboard. You can browse to the location of your image file and click Open. You will see your image in the catalog window. You can then drag and drop it onto your model as before.
 
## Step 3: Add lights and shadows
 
The third step is to add lights and shadows to your model to create a realistic atmosphere and mood for your scene. Lights are sources of illumination that affect the brightness and color of your model and its surroundings. Shadows are areas of darkness that are created by blocking the light from reaching certain parts of your model or its surroundings.
 
To add lights and shadows to your model, you can use the built-in tools of Artlantis Studio 7.0.2.2 or import your own images as light sources. The tools include Heliodon (sun), Neon (linear), Spot (point), Area (plane), IES (photometric), HDRi (spherical), etc. You can access the tools by clicking on the Light button on the toolbar or by pressing F6 on your keyboard.
 
To add a light source from the tools to your model, simply drag and drop it onto the location that you want to place it in your scene. You will see a preview of the light source on your model in the main window. You can also adjust the parameters of the light source by clicking on the Inspector button on the toolbar or by pressing F5 on your keyboard.
 
To import your own images as light sources, you can click on the Import button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+I on your keyboard. You can browse to the location of your image file and click Open. You will see your image in the catalog window. You can then drag and drop it onto your scene as before.
